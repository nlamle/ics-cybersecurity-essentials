AI Use Statement

Acknowledgement of Generative AI Assistance

We used generative AI (Cursor's Agent) in the development of this encryption lab project under the following conditions:

Purpose of AI Assistance:
- To assist in understanding encryption concepts and implementation approaches
- To help with code structure and organization
- To convert content between different formats (Markdown to LaTeX)
- To refine and improve existing work

AI Usage Boundaries:
- The core encryption logic, educational objectives, and final implementation decisions were our own work
- We reviewed, tested, and understood all AI-generated code before implementation
- We modified and adapted AI suggestions to ensure they met the specific requirements of the assignment

Prompts Used:
1. "let's use a virtual environment. give me the steps i should follow to set up this project. my folder is called encryption_tool"
2. "restructure my code to have a logical flow"
3. "these paragraphs take up one and a half pages. shorten them for me such that they will fill just a page. avoid rephrasing as much as possible, but remove any sentences that may not be too necessary: [content]"
4. "can you convert this report to latex format for me? and put this information on the cover page, centered: [team information]"

Verification of Understanding:
We confirm that we understand the encryption concepts demonstrated in this project, including:
- The differences between ECB, CBC, and CTR modes
- Why ECB mode leaks patterns in encrypted images
- How proper key and IV management prevents security vulnerabilities
- The implementation of AES and DES encryption algorithms

The AI was used as a tool to enhance our learning and productivity, not to complete the assignment on our behalf.
